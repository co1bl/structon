## Core Principles

When contributing, keep these principles in mind:

1. **Self-similarity** — The pattern is sense → act → feedback at all scales
2. **Simplicity** — One pattern, infinite complexity
3. **Everything is structon** — Code is data, data is code
4. **Tension drives action** — Unresolved = high tension
